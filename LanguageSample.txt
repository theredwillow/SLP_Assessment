Amelia Bedelia is always silly. She wears maid outfit all day long. She works for Mrs. Rogers. She made creampuffs and put them on the stove. Then she poured the coffee in the cereal. Mrs. Rogers did not like coffee in her cereal. She told Amelia to go away and not come back. Then Amelia left and went to the hair cut store. The boss told her to pin a customer’s hair up. She put safety pins in a lady’s hair. She put the wrong pins in! She got in trouble and left again.  She went to a clothes store and the lady said she wants help. The dresses needed to be shorter. Amelia did not sew it she cut it instead. The clothes store boss told her to leave and not come back. She was in trouble again so she went to the paper store. The man told her to put stamps on envelopes. She decided to walk on the paper with her shoes and stamp her feet. The man told her that was wrong.  Then he told her to file some papers. Amelia does not listen so she cut up the papers! Then she went to help at the doctor’s office and got in trouble again. The doctor told her to bring in the patients. So she picked up and carried the kids in.  That was wrong so the doctor was not happy. Then she put on the doctor gloves but she was not supposed to. So she went back to her house and wanted to make Mrs. Rogers happy.  She made some chocolate cream for the cream puffs.  She thought she was still in trouble and almost left the house again. Mrs. Rogers told her to stay. She said sorry and they were happy. Mr. Rogers wanted some soup for dinner. Amelia put a whole can in a pot. She is so silly and she did not understand.
